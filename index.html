      5 Ways of Thinking Like a Programmer
    </h2>
      <ul class = "one">
        <li>Procedural Thinking - creating prefectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
        <li>Abstract Thinking - finding the similarity or generality amongst seemingly different things.</li>
        <li>Systematic Debugging - relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program to not to work.  When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake/bug somewhere in the computer code.</li>
        <li>Technological Empathy - comes in many forms.  For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what its good and bad at doing.</li>
        <li>Systems Thinking - happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <h2>
        What components make up the the World Wide Web?
      </h2>
      <ul class = "two">
        <li><em>HTTP</em> - Protocol for the web.</li>
        <li><em>Servers</em> - Computers that have the files that makeup the web.</li>
        <li><em>Internet</em> - The world's largest computer network.</li>
        <li><em>Browser</em> - A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your browser, and servers.

       <h2>
        Basic HTML Language
      </h2>
       <ul class = "three">
        <li><em>Tag</em> - an HTML tag is always contained with brackets.  Most have an opening and closing tag.  
        Void tags do not require a closing tag.</li>
        <li><em>Element</em> - refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</li>
        <li><em>Attibute</em> - This is a property of an HTML element.  
        For example:<a href= "www.udacity.com"> Udacity.com</a></li>

   Major pieces of the web: you, your computer, the Internet, and servers.

      <h3>
        The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents that include:
      </h3>
    <ul class = "five">
          <li> HTML</li>
          <li> Hyperlinks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are both "languages".
      HTML,<em>Hypertext Markup Language, </em>controls the structure of the webpage and 
      CSS, <em> Cascading Style Sheets,</em> controls the style of the  page; how it works.
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" <em>Document Object Model</em> they are talking about the <b>tree-like</b> structure of a page.
    </p>
       <h3>
        HTML is made up of:
     </h3>
     <ul class = "six">
        <li> Text content ---what you see.</li>
        <li> Markup --- what it looks like.</li>
        <li> References to other documents.</li>
        <li> Links to other pages.</li>
     </ul>
    <p>
      HTML documents are made up of HTML elements. 
      HTML elements comprise of an opening tag, contents, and closing tag.

      <h3>
        Computers are Stupid!!
      </h3>
    <p>
      Think about how sensitive computers are to typos and how small mistakes can lead to huge problems when given to the 'stupid' computer.
    </p>
      <h3>
        Inline vs Block Elements
      </h3>
    <p>
      Inline Elements end a line.  Block elements create an invisible box around the text that has 
      height and width features.

      <em>HTML</em> files are like the structure of your house. <br>
      <em>CSS</em> files are like the style of your house.  For example, the color of your walls.<br>
      <em>Javascript</em> files are like your interactive functions.  For example, your remote control.

      Browsers create a tree-like structure of the web.

      Session 1: Introduction to "Serious" Programming

    <ul class = "nine">
     <li> A <b> Web Crawler</b> is a program that collects content by following links from other webpages.</li>
     <li> A <b>Computer</b> is a machine that can be programmed to do whatever you want it to do.</li>
     <li> A <b> Computer Program </b> is a precise sequence of steps that tells the computer what to do.</li>
     <li> When you divide an integer (number without a decimal) by another integer, Python does something called <b> integer division</b> which means it ignores the decimal part of the number.  To force Python to give you an answer including a decimal, you need to make one of the numbers into a decimal point after it.  For example 5/2.0, gives 2.5, and so does 5.0/2. </li>
     <li> A <b>Programming Language</b> is what programmers use to tell computers what to do.  Python, Cobol, and Fortran are examples of programming languages.</li>
     <li><b>Python</b> is a programming language that utilizes a <em> Python Intepreter</em> to follow the instructions of your code in a way that the computer understands. </li>
     <li> <b> Grammer</b> is very important when writing code.  You must use a set of instructions that is correct, precise and one that the computer understands.</li>
     <li><b>Python Expressions</b> can be explained in the following <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud552-nd/l-3527838955/e-48704311/m-48736065" target="_blank"> video.</a>

      Session 2: Variables and Strings
    </h2>
    <ul class = "ten">
      <li><b>Variable</b> - a name that refers to a value.  A variable name in Python can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.  However, the 1st character cannot be a number.  Variables are case sensitive.  For example, <em>username</em> is not the same as <em>userName</em>.</li>
      <li>The <b>= </b>sign is an assignment statement and it is used to assign a value to a variable.  It means we are assigning the value on the right side of the = sign to the variable on the left.  Example myAge = 25.</li>
      <li>A <b>String</b> is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes.  For example: <em>'I am a string'</em> or <em>"I am a string".</em></li>

      Session 3: Inputs->Functions->Output
    </h2>
    <ul class = "ten">
      <li><b>Functions</b> takes <b>input</b>, do something with it, and then produces <b>output.</b></li>
      <li>A function begins with <em>def</em> defines/names a function.  For example: <em>def</em> myName(x): </li>
      <li><em>def</em> tells the program that the indented code from the next line onwards is part of the function.
      <li>The line must end with a <b>:</b> colon</li>
      <li>The function name is followed by an open parentheses, followed by the value of the required parameters, followed by a closed parentheses.</li>
      <li>Every line within a function must be indented.</li>
      <li>There can be more than one <em>return</em> statements in a function.</li>
      <li>Once the function executes a <em> return</em> statement, the function will exit.
      <li>Functions that produce an output, ends with a <em>return</em> statement.</li>
      <li>To Display a function on the screen, you must include the <b>print</b> statement before you call your function.</li>
      <li>Some of the advantages of using <em>Functions</em> are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Reduces Debugging time by making it easier to locate an mistake within the code.</li>
          <li>Reduces coding time by allowing you to write the routine once, and code statements that call it.</li>
          <li>Improved readability of the program.</li>
          <li>Reduces duplication of code.</li>
          <li>Aids in breaking down complex problems into simplier pieces.</li>
          <li>Allows reuse of code.</li>

    </h2>
    <ul class = "eleven">
      <li>The equality comparison is made by using <b>'=='</b> instead of <b>'='</b> because the <b>'='</b> means assignment.  For example: 7 * 3 == 21</li>
      <li><b>Loops</b> are a way to do things over and over.</li>
      <li><b>If</b> statements evaluate if a certain condition is met, and to perform the appropriate action based on the result of the evaluation.</li>
      <li><b>While</b> loops repeatedly executes instructions insided the loop while a certain condition is true.</li>
      <li><b>Debugging</b> Strategy
        <ul>
          <li>Examine error messages when programs crash.  The last line of Python Tracebacks will tell you what line it crashed on, what file it was running, and how it got there.</li>
          <li>Work from example code.  If you modified code doesn't work, comment it out and step-by-step modify the example code until it does what you want.</li>
          <li>Makes sure examples work.</li>
          <li>Check/print intermediate results.  Add print statements in your code to make sure that your program is doing what you want it to do.</li>
          <li>Keep and compare old versions. When troublshooting your code, save it before you add more code.  This will give you something to go back to if you introduce to many new bugs.</li>

      <li><b>For Loops </b>executes a block of code repeatedly until the condition in the <em>for</em> statement is no longer valid.</li>
